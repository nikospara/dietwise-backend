# Coding conventions

## General

1. TAB for indentation.
2. 2 TABs for line continuation.

## For pom.xml

### Dependencies

1. Group and sort dependencies as follows:
	- First is the classification of the dependency with the following order: PROJECT (dependencies from within the
	project), FRAMEWORK dependencies, SPECS (specification APIs e.g. JAX-RS), OTHER (other non-test libraries),
	PROJECT TEST (test-scoped dependencies from within the project), FRAMEWORK TEST, TEST (libraries intended for test
	scope, like JUnit and Mockito).
	- Within each classification group sort alphabetically, first by Maven groupId, then by artifactId.
2. Do NOT define the scope of the dependencies in the `<dependencyManagement>` section of any pom.xml, define it when
actually used. This allows us to have e.g., project-specific test modules that depend on JUnit in compile scope.
3. Define the version of dependencies in properties, even if used only in a single dependency. This makes it easy to
upgrade dependencies with `mvn -N versions:display-property-updates`.
4. If a project (Maven module) uses artifacts from a dependency directly, it's preferable to declare the dependency
directly rather than rely on transitive dependencies.

# Naming conventions

## Packages

1. All prefixed by the project prefix, `eu.dietwise`. Do not use the default (unnamed) package!
2. Packages containing exposed APIs should have a version component following the project or module prefix,
e.g. `eu.dietwise.v1` or `eu.dietwise.foo.v1` (see 4 below). The version package component should come after the
package name of the Maven project (module) it is located. Other packages may follow the version component,
e.g. `eu.dietwise.foo.v1.model` or `eu.dietwise.foo.v1.service.impl`.
3. Place common code i.e., code potentially useful to many modules, under a package name appropriate for the
implemented functionality. E.g., classes under `eu.dietwise.jpa` implement reusable, JPA-related functionality.
4. Each bounded context gets its own package under the project prefix (e.g. `eu.dietwise.foo` or `eu.dietwise.user`).
Create appropriate sub-packages.

## Classes

**TBD/INCOMPLETE**

1. Name JPA entities after the domain with the `-Entity` suffix, e.g. `UserEntity`
2. **INCOMPLETE** Name the model interface after the domain, adding the suffix `-Data`, e.g. `UserData`. Use the `-Data` suffix for
types that are input to business logic, even if they do not correspond to domain types.
3. **INCOMPLETE** Name concrete implementations of domain objects that act as arguments to the APIs after the domain with the `-Param`
suffix, e.g. `UserParam`
4. **INCOMPLETE** Name classes that are (more or less) full representations of a domain object to an external API with the `-Dto` suffix, e.g. `UserSearchResultDto`
	- **What is the difference between `-Param` and `-Dto`?**
		1. `-Param` is *input* to an API, when the data differ significantly from the domain object
		2. `-Dto` can be *both input and output*, both when there is no relevant domain object for the transferred data, or when the information we need to transfer closely matches the structure of the domain object.
5. Classes used as inputs/outputs of endpoints and are not part of the main model have the `-Request`/`-Response`
suffix respectively.
6. Classes used as inputs/outputs of services and are not part of the main model have the `-Param`/`-Result`
suffix respectively.
7. When a word component of a Java identifier is all capitals, de-capitalize it, e.g. "DTO" &rarr; "SomethingDto", "DAO" &rarr; "SomethingDao".

## Tests

1. Name the tested thing `sut` for "system under test"

## Communication endpoints

1. URLs for REST resources will follow the plural naming e.g. `/api/v1/customers`.
2. The resource class follows the same convention with the `-Resource` suffix, e.g. `CustomersResource`.

## Database artifacts

1. Names are `SNAKE_CASE`
2. Tables: capitals (even though it should not matter) like `DW_<NAME>`, where:
	- `<NAME>` is the name of the domain object (not the entity, i.e., without the `-Entity` suffix)
	- `<NAME>` is *singular*
	- E.g., `DW_USER` would be a table for users.
3. Columns: minuscules, no prefix or suffix
4. Primary key constraints: `PK_<TABLE>`, and `<TABLE>` is the full table name as specified above
5. Not null constraints: `NL_<TABLE>__<COLUMN>`, the column name is capitalized
6. Unique constraints: `UQ_<TABLE>__<COLUMN>`, the column name is capitalized
7. Foreign key columns: name them like `<target_table_without_prefix>_<target_column>`; minuscule as all columns
8. Foreign key constraints: `FK_<SRC_TABLE>__<SRC_COL>__<TARGET_TABLE>__<TARGET_COL>`; capitals and table names without prefixes
9. Indexes: `IX_<TABLE>__<COLUMN>`

**TODO:** How to deal with the name size limit of PostgreSQL? (Which is 61, see the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS))

## DAOs

1. Place methods to DAOs according to the returned type. If it returns `SomethingEntity` or `Collection<SomethingEntity`, it belongs to the `SomethingDao`.
2. Never name methods that access the DB with a `get-` prefix. They look like ordinary getters.
	- Use `find-` or `findBy-` if the method may return `null`/empty `Optional`
	- Use `require-` or `requireBy-` if the method throws when it does not find a result
