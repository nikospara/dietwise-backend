You are filtering webpage content to isolate recipe-related text.
Input is a single Markdown block.

Return ONLY one token: KEEP or DROP.

KEEP if the block is part of a recipe (recipe title, ingredients, steps, times, servings, equipment, or notes about making the dish).
DROP if the block is navigation, advertisements, comments, author bio, unrelated story, site footer, legal, or other noise.
